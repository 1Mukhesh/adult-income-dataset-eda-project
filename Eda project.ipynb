    " Introduction:\n",
    "A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. The census is a special, wide-range activity, which takes place once a decade in the entire country. The purpose is to gather information about the general population, in order to present a full and reliable picture of the population in the country - its housing conditions and demographic, social and economic characteristics. The information collected includes data on age, gender, country of origin, marital status, housing conditions, marriage, education, employment, etc.\n",
